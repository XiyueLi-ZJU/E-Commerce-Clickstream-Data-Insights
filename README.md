**Introduction**

ğŸŒŸ This project utilizes the [Clickstream Data for Online Shopping](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/553/clickstream+data+for+online+shopping) dataset - detailed clickstream records from an online store specializing in maternity wear. The dataset is available at UCI Machine Learning Repository.

ğŸ§° By integrating <span style="color:blue">**data engineering** (data modeling, SQL ETL)</span> practices and <span style="color:blue">**data science** (statistics analysis, Machine Learning)</span> techniques, this project aims to provide a deep dive into customer behaviors to uncover actionable insights that drive business growth. 

ğŸ”§ An efficient data model that reflects the structure and relationships of online retail data is developed to enable efficient data storage and query. In addition, the data model is structured to facilitate seamless data integration across various departments within the organization, such as different product lines, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, and Customer Service. 

ğŸ”¦ This project also leverages machine learning to optimize marketing strategies and inventory management in the maternity clothing market.
